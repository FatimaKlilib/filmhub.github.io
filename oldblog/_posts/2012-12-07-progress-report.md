Hello,
A quick progress report for everyone involved in the KinoNation beta test:

###Upload Manager
Most of you have already uploaded your films, so you’ll have used our Upload Manager software. We continue to develop this to make it faster and more efficient. The latest version allows the upload to happen from multiple locations simultaneously, which means must more bandwidth is available. So if you haven’t uploaded your film yet, now is an excellent time. Email me if you need the login details.

###Transcoding
We’ve built an initial, working version of the cloud-based transcoding system. Uploaded films are immediately transcoded into a “Preview” version which serves as an online “screener” for our VOD output partners. And then transcoded into the custom versions for VOD platforms as needed.

###Dashboard
We’re busy building the web based “dashboard” that video-on-demand platforms will use to preview films after they’re uploaded to KinoNation (right now we’re just sending a spreadsheet of films with synopses, trailer link, etc. which is old school and not very efficient.) Once this is live we’ll be able to really crank up the exposure of your films to dozens of platforms, rather than just the handful that we’re working with on the beta-test. There will also be a “filmmaker dashboard” where you can check the Preview version of your film and see which VOD platforms have reviewed it — and whether they accept or reject!

###Terms & Conditions
We’re close to releasing the next version of the website where content owners will be able to select the outlets they want their film submitted to, read and agree to the Terms & Conditions for each of the outlets, and then review and digitally sign a “blanket” agreement with KinoNation that gives us the right to distribute to VOD.

###Metadata
We’re also close to releasing a new metadata interface that will capture a “super-set” of information about each film, so that we can deliver everything conceivable that’s needed for various VOD platforms.

###In Summary
We’re working as hard and fast as we can to launch KinoNation in the new year. It’s a very complex set of software engineering & technology challenges, and it takes time to write the code, but we’re making rapid progress. And on the business development side we’re busy lining up more and more VOD output partners, including the most of the major platforms.

Warmest,

Roger
