        <p>Kinonation is a start-up solving a big problem in the content supply chain for video-on-demand (VoD) platforms such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, iTunes, Google Play and hundreds of non-US VoD outlets. Our cloud-based Distribution-as-a-Service (DaaS) delivers a 100x cost reduction in the highly complex and wholly non-standardized process of ingesting, transcoding, authoring & delivering movie assets for VoD.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Beta clients Hulu, Amazon, iTunes</li>
          <li>Gives content creators distribution access to global VoD network</li>
          <li>Crushes VoD supply chain costs 100x</li>
          <li>CTO Klaus Badelt scored Pirates of the Caribbean, Gladiator, Beijing Olympics</li>
          <li>CEO Roger Jackson was head of content at iFilm.com, Lexis-Nexis Hong Kong</li>
          <li>Revenue $2k Q2/13 → $20k Q3/13 --> $20m Q4/18</li>
          <li>Based in Santa Monica, CA</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Every year 25,000 feature length films are completed globally, but less than 2,000 are distributed. The rest languish or are under-exploited, unable to get theatrical, TV or DVD distribution. There’s now a pool of 250,000+ under-exploited feature film assets, representing an investment of at least $50 billion (assuming $200k average production cost per film). Each year $5 billion of movie product is made but not even offered for sale to the public, trapped in a high cost, inefficient, legacy distribution system. These films can now be monetized via VoD in multiple formats, countries & languages.
        </p>
        <p>
          BUT: Prepping & delivering feature film assets for VoD is highly complex, wholly unstandardized, inefficient and expensive. Kinonation solves that problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kinonation does not compete with Netflix, iTunes, Amazon, Hulu and the 1000+ digital and cable VoD outlets throughout the world. We supply movies to them at scale.
        </p>
        <p>
          KinoNation is a cloud-based Distribution-as-a-Service (DaaS) pipeline for content owners to distribute and monetize under-exploited feature films. Our enterprise software allows these massive digital assets to be uploaded, stored, transcoded, packaged and distributed at scale to VoD outlets & channels worldwide, in multiple languages. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Revenue is generated from VoD outlets and Distribution-as-a-Service (DaaS) fees from studios, distributors, and catalog owners.

        <p>Each year $5 billion of movie product is made but not even offered for sale to the public, trapped in a broken, high cost, inefficient, legacy distribution system. There are hundreds of high quality feature film catalogs that are radically under-exploited -- which can now be monetized via Video-on-Demand (VoD) in multiple formats, countries & languages. Kinonation does not compete with Netflix, iTunes, Amazon, Hulu and the hundreds of digital and cable VoD outlets throughout the world.
