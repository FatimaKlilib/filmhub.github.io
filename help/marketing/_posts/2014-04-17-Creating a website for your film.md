Kinonation has partnered with Assemble to help filmmakers who need to rapidly build a custom website for their film. Assemble is the only web CMS (Content Management System) and CRM (Customer Relationship Manager) made specifically for running the marketing and distribution of a slate of films. The Assemble framework powers three core marketing tools, the website, branded trailer and Facebook page apps. These are hosted by Assemble and are easily customized and really editable from the Assemble admin system.
