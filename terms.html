        <h2><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-user"></span> Human-Readable Summary</h2>
        <p>This is non-legally-binding introductory summary of (and not a substitute for) the <a href="#legal">terms &amp; conditions</a>. Read the <a href="#" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-title="Disclaimer" data-content="This summary highlights only some of the key features of the actual terms &amp; conditions. It is not an agreement and has no legal value. You should carefully review the actual terms &amp; conditions."> disclaimer.</a></p>

        <div class="alert alert-success">
          <h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-thumbs-up"></span> You grant Filmhub the right to:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Distribute</strong> your titles and associated metadata to Channels</li>
            <li><strong>Collect</strong> all revenue from Channels in connection with your titles, which we then pass on to you less our <a href="/#pricing">revenue share</a></li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="alert alert-info">
          <h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span> With the understanding that:</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>You control the necessary rights</li>
            <li>You can withdraw your title(s) from Filmhub at any time, but remain bound to the rules of Channels already delivered to</li>
            <li>Channels may decline titles. Your titles are <em>not</em> guaranteed to be on all Channels, or any particular Channel.</li>
            <li>You can opt out territories and Channels</li>
            <li>You communicate with our Channels only through us, not directly</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>Some most-asked questions:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Am I signing over all distribution rights?</strong> No.
            The only rights we take are the obvious ones we need to run the service.
            For example, the right to deliver the titles you upload to Channels on your behalf.</li>
          <li><strong>Can I upload "unsold" titles only?</strong> No. We operate <em>non-exclusively</em>. We can augment other distribution deals you might have with territories and streaming channels they don't cover. We just ask not to deliver to the same streaming channels. You can exclude specific streaming channels and territories per title.</li>
          <li><strong>Am I tied into a long term contract?</strong> No. You can pull your titles anytime. There might be some delay by the terms of platforms already delivered to, though.</li>
        </ol>
