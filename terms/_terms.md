8.  Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy

    1. Notice and Takedown Procedure
    
    It is our policy to expeditiously respond to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). This page describes the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to  Kinonation as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the form suggested by the DMCA (the text of which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office Website, http://www.copyright.gov), but we will respond to notices of this form from other jurisdictions as well.
    It is expected that all users of any part of the KINONATION site will comply with applicable copyright laws. However, if KINONATION receives proper notification of claimed copyright infringement, our response to these notices will include removing or disabling access to material claimed to be the subject of infringing activity and/or terminating subscribers, regardless of whether we may be liable for such infringement under United States law or the laws of another jurisdiction.
    If we remove or disable access in response to such a notice, we will make a good-faith attempt to contact the owner or administrator of the affected site or content so that they may make a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. We may also document notices of alleged infringement on which we act. 

    1. Designated Agent
    
    KINONATION's Designated Agent for notification of alleged infringement under the DMCA is:
