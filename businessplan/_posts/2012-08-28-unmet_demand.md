## Unmet Demand

The opportunity to build a highly scalable and successful business in the Video-On-Demand sector exists at the confluence of three dynamics: a global under-exploited asset base, unmet VOD demand for diverse content in an expanding market and the disruptive market efficiencies now possible with low-cost technology.

During the last decade, sectors across the entire entertainment industry have been disrupted and radically changed by new technology. The once robust physical DVD market has been disrupted by the rise of VOD services that provide an array of media content through connected TVs, set-top-boxes, computers, smart phones, tablets and other devices.

The VOD market had shifted from a supply based distribution model to one where consumers have the power to choose what they want to watch, where they want to watch it and on what device. The internet, social sharing and new low cost  technology have re-ordered the entire content discovery and distribution eco-system, and the dramatic shift in VOD content consumption is propelling rapid market growth.

However the VOD distribution sector is vulnerable to disruption, as it does not match demand with supply in efficient ways. The majority of film/TV/specialty content is either underexploited or not exploited at all. Hundreds of thousands of films, TV programs and visual media are not being exploited to the maximum by content creators & content owners around the globe because of market barriers and supply chain inefficiencies. Valuable content is not coming into the market and is not being offered to consumers by VOD outlets. This huge problem presents a tremendous opportunity to technology focused, agile entrepreneurs.
