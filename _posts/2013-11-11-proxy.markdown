The film industry will follow the same – or similar – trajectory as the music industry has over the past decade. The music industry has transitioned from an industry dominated by record labels and brand-name artists, to a wholly re-ordered ecosystem where individuals are not only content creators but also content owners, and where enterprises like CD Baby (b2c) and TuneCore (b2b) dominate independent music creation and distribution. The high probability that the film industry will follow the same trajectory provides a view into the future and lowers the risk profile for investments in the digital distribution space. Meanwhile, the technology that enabled the digital music revolution – bandwidth, storage, software – are just now at the point where massive feature film files can be uploaded, automatically transcoded to multiple formats, delivered to VoD outlets and made available to a global audience.
