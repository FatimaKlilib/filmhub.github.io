##Proprietary Technology

### From Content Owner to Cloud
KN has a fully-automated, all digital work-flow. Which means no hard drives, no DVD screeners, and above all no expensive human sitting in a room full of equipment encoding each film "by hand." Instead filmmakers upload their massive 100Gb+ master video file (plus trailer, metadata, images, etc.) via our proprietary Upload software. It all happens in the cloud which makes it radically faster, more efficient and less expensive.

### Storage
Cloud-based film storage is a significant expense, on average around $5 per film per month. We optimize film storage so that the most in-demand films -- which are typically demanded by each new outlet we add -- are always available in their optimal size format. Other films -- those that are less in demand -- are compressed down to roughly 20% of their original size, shrinking storage overhead accordingly, but still allowing us to deliver the film to most of the Tier B outlets likely to demand these titles.

### Transcode
This upload-transcode-distribute process is at the core of our vision for KinoNation.  We intend to create a platform that provides filmmakers with a fast, free and frictionless path to global digital distribution of their film.  We expect KinoNation to be a no-brainer decision for filmmakers throughout the world -- a fundamentally simple and satisfying experience with zero downside -- resulting in rapid growth of the KinoNation content library. This core value proposition means content owners upload once, distribute to all, while retaining total control of their content.  Wherever their film exists on the “long tail” of sales, they receive the majority of the revenue, with a flat percentage commission retained by KinoNation. Near real-time reporting coupled with a commitment to full transparency will round out the emphasis on an all-round great experience for filmmakers, VoD partners and film consumers.

### Metadata Authoring
At the core of the value we deliver, our proprietary metadata ingest system allows us to automatically “author” custom metadata for each VoD outlet we deliver to.

### Packaging & Delivery
We automatically package the required custom movie assets for each VoD outlet -- and then deliver to the outlet’s ingest server, either via SFTP or direct to the Amazon Web Services S3 bucket for that outlet.

### Ranking System
We hired a Harvard PhD statistician and filmmaker to build KinoFactor, a proprietary ranking system that ranks any film on a 1-100 scale of probable VoD success, based on 40+ empirical data points, including aggregate talent ranking, producer track record, festival performance, social media performance, trailer views, etc. This helps VoD outlets select the most promising films, and helps filmmakers understand what they need to accomplish in order to improve their film's ranking -- and thus it's chances to be profitable.
