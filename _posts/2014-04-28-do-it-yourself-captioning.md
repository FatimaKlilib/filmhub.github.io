We recommend the following do-it-yourself solutions for creating, editing and converting subtitles & closed captions:

Online captioning:

* Subtitle Edit
* YouTube captions creator
* CaptionTube
* Amara

Desktop apps:

* Subtitle Workshop
* MovCaptioner
* Telestream
* SRTed - great for fixing overlapping subtitles

You can use these apps and web apps to convert to .SRT as well.
