###Explosive Growth
VoD will continue to grow explosively as DVD sales decline. Is it a zero-sum game? Probably not, but it’s complex. Per unit rentals or sales via VoD tend to be lower dollar amounts than for DVD. But the ubiquity of multiple devices to consume VoD will mean consumers watch more movies each month than they watched on DVD. Producers want to get their film on as many digital and cable VoD platforms as possible, in multiple languages and countries. It’ll be common to commence watching a film in the evening on a connected TV, then watch a little more of that film on your phone while you ride the subway, then finish viewing on a tablet during a coffee break at work.

Global online TV and video revenues will reach $28.72 billion in 2017, a massive increase from the $3.79 billion recorded in 2010 and the $11.14 billion expected in 2012. The over-the-top TV sector is on the brink of a huge take-off as the key players expand globally, companies consolidate and as new partnerships are announced on a daily basis. By 2017, 480 million homes in 40 countries will watch online television and video, up from 182 million in 2010. By 2017, 64.6% of the world’s 745 million fixed broadband homes will view television and video online, up from 33.5% of the 473 million fixed broadband total in 2010.
