### Prove that:
1. content owners will embrace and use a platform like Kinonation.
2. video-on-demand platforms will accept and program films from KinoNation.
3. we can execute on the technology promise -- a platform for filmmakers to upload massive movie files and then automatically transcode those files and deliver them at superb quality to dozens of VoD platforms, worldwide.
4. these films will actually find a paying audience to rent or buy them, and therefore create a revenue stream to filmmakers and to KinoNation
