### Exploiting the Catalog
These efficiencies allow us to waive the upfront fees that other aggregators charge. Our philosophy is that KinoNation only wins when filmmakers win. Thus no fixed fees -- instead we charge a flat 20% of the revenue generated by a film across multiple VoD outlets (or 15% for a catalog of 5 films or more.) If the film makes nothing, we make nothing. We think this is fair, democratic, and allows us to attract filmmakers at the most financially challenged point in the life of the film.

### Distribution as a Service
Alternatively, we will provide our technology on a fee per film per outlet basis -- what we call Distribution-as-a-Service. This is the business model preferred by Hollywood studios and distributors -- they prefer to pay a flat fee (per film, per outlet) rather than pay a percentage of VoD revenue.
