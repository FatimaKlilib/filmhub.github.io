KinoNation marketing is focused on our “input partners” - filmmakers, independent producers, foreign film aggregators, film libraries, etc. It’s focused on media relations - getting editorial coverage in influential online and offline publications.  Our first PR deal partnership is a weekly column (starting 8/28/12) on the influential Hope for Film group of blogs run by indie film guru Ted Hope. We’ll be marketing via other film sites, such as Ain’t It Cool News, JoBlo.com, The Wrap.  We’ll be speaking at film festivals.  And we’ll be leveraging our media expertise across Facebook, Twitter, Flixster, etc.
