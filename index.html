        <p>Upload your film (TV show, short etc.), trailer, artwork and enter metadata using our unique Upload Manager.

        <p>Your video assets are transcoded into many formats as required by our digital outlets, for example iTunes, Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and many more.

    <h1>Controlling a catalog of titles? <small>Kinonation Enterprise Edition</small></h1>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-5 lead">
        <p>Producers, sales agents, distributors, mini majors, studios: if you own or control high profile titles or a large scale catalog, whether it's 5 or 5000: we are making you a distribution offer. For all of them.</p>
        <p>Right here.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-7">
        <p>DVD is dying. Blu-ray was never alive. VOD is taking over. But traditional distribution channels only have you on, say, a handful of outlets. In a few territories. If you're lucky. Next year there will be no more DVD. What about your catalog?</p>
        <p>But unlike one single DVD/Blu-ray standard, there are now as many as there are outlets. Hundreds. Plus all the accounting. Kinonation gets your titles in front of <em>every</em> outlet, in the whole world. All accounting is consolidated. Payments within 30 days of receipt. Automatically.</p>
        <p>It's a growing market - as new outlets appear, we re-deliver your whole catalog automatically. No additional cost.  With our cloud-based app you're future proof. No conversion costs.</p>
        <p>You can also keep your old distribution and sales relationships <em>and</em> enter the new age. Carve out territories and select only specific VOD outlets with fine grained control. Set different release dates for transactional, ad-based and subscription based VOD. You can have your cake and eat it.</p>
        <p>We are scalable to infinite catalog sizes. </p>
        <p>We also offer a one-time service fee in exchange of the commission structure. <a href="mailto:roger@kinonation.com?subject=Kinonation Enterprise">Contact us.</a></p>
