###General Information
1. Is KinoNation fully launched and up & running?

    Yes. We’ve completed most of the very complex software engineering, and we’ve signed multiple deals with video-on-demand platforms in the U.S. and internationally. We have over 100 features and documentaries in our beta test and we’re delivering multiple films each day to our beta partners such as Hulu, Amazon, Viewster, etc.

1. What is video-on-demand?

    Video-on-Demand is a system to allow users to select and watch video content on demand, delivered instantly via the internet, cable, wireless, etc.

1. What’s the difference between buy and rent?

    When consumers buy a film online they are downloading a digital copy that they own forever. Whereas renting a film online allows them to stream (or sometimes download) with a limited use license, typically 24-48 hours. Once the rental period has expired, the film is no longer watchable.

1. What format should my film be?

    You film should be Apple ProRes 422 HQ. See upload specs.

1. What happens to my film after I upload?

    Your film is stored on our secure servers. Then we transcode it to multiple formats — for the many different digital outlets around the world

1. What If I want to remove my film from KN?

    No problem. It’s your film. Remove at any time.

1. Can’t I go to iTunes directly?

    No directly, but you _could_ submit your title(s) to one of few iTunes approved encoders. They charge you, though - typically several hundred dollars for their services. They also might simply deny your title(s). Most Kinonation customers also prefer our consolidated accounting across all VOD outlets worldwide.

1. Do I need Errors and Omissions (E&O) insurance for my film?

    Generally no if you’re only targeting internet VoD distribution outlets. Generally yes if you are seeking to get your film distributed via Cable VoD.

1. Does the quality of my film stay the same after I upload to Kinonation?

    Yes, definitely. The ProRes file that you upload will be used by KinoNation to make the different “mezzanine” files for each VoD outlet.

1. Can I send you a hard drive?

    No, we have a much faster, simpler and entirely automated transcoding system that means you can upload your film to us. We can hand the reduced cost compared to handling drives through to you. No hard drives, no FedEx, no delays, no fees.

1. Is my film guaranteed to get on all the VoD platforms you have deals with?

    No. Every VoD platform will decide to accept or reject a film according to their own criteria for genre, subject matter, talent, festivals, etc.

1. What’s the turnaround between uploading and having the film on VoD platforms?

    It’s available for the platforms to select within hours of the upload. How long they take to select or reject is up to them.

1. Is the rollout timing across various platforms all completely up to the filmmaker?

    Yes, but obviously the platforms decide what films they want to take, and they’ll want their release date to be competitive with everyone else.

###Money
1. What the payment percentage for the VoD services?

    Kinonation charges 20% of the revenue your film generates on each digital distribution service.

1. When will I get paid?

    We pay you as soon as the digital distributors pay us.

1. How do I get paid?

    We will pay you via PayPal.

1. What if I want to replace my film with a new version?

    No problem. Simply log into your Kinonation account and upload your replacement film, which will become the film we deliver from that point on.

1. How do I add sub-titles to my film?

    You can use commercial or open source sub-title applications (such as MovieCaptioner, MacCaption or Gnome Subtitles.) You can upload sub-titles as metadata that is only used for the relevant language/territory version of the film.

1. What if I have multiple films to upload?

    You can upload as many films to Kinonation as you wish.

1. Do you accept short films?

    No, we’re focused on features and documentaries, defined by AMPAS as 40 minutes or longer. We may re-visit this decision in the future as we partner with more platforms that accept shorts.

1. Can I edit my metadata?

    Yes, you can log-in to your account at any time to edit your metadata, although this will not be reflected on the versions of your film that are already in digital distribution.

1. Can I choose which territories or countries to upload to?

    Yes, absolutely. You select the countries and outlets you want your film distributed to.

1. Why are you called Kinonation?

    We chose the name because: ki·no – a motion-picture theater; cinema. nat·ion – a community of persons bound by shared interest or passion
